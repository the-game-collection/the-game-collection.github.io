To win each match you must get to 10 points with a 2 point lead - if the scores reach 10-9 the game goes on until someone has a 2 point lead or reaches 15, in a similar manner to tennis. There are nine skill levels to beat, with increasing abilities as the game goes on. The human player has the advantage of serving first, and as the serve reverses every five points, you are guaranteed to have at least as many chances to serve than your opponent (remember the significance of 10 and 15 in the scoring). The points system rewards long rallies and large winning margins, as you get points for each hit, for each point won, and for each point of the winning margin.</p>"},{"name":"Pink Panther","year":1988,"developer":"reLINE Software"},{"name":"Pipe Dream","year":1990,"developer":"The Assembly Line"},{"name":"Pippo","year":1986,"developer":""},{"name":"Piso Zero","year":1991,"developer":"Zigurat Software S.L."},{"name":"Pit-Fighter","year":1991,"developer":"Atari Games Corporation"},{"name":"Pit-Fighter / Super Space Invaders","year":1991,"developer":""},{"name":"Pitfall II: Lost Caverns","year":1984,"developer":"Activision Inc."},{"name":"Pitman Seven","year":1983,"developer":""},{"name":"Pixel Quest","year":2015,"developer":""},{"name":"Pixel Quest 2000","year":2017,"developer":""},{"name":"Planet 10","year":1989,"developer":""},{"name":"Planet of Shades","year":1986,"developer":"Cybexlab Software"},{"name":"Planetfall","year":1984,"developer":""},{"name":"Planetoids","year":1982,"developer":"Psion Software Ltd."},{"name":"Planets, The","year":1986,"developer":"Channel Four Television Corporation"},{"name":"Platoon","year":1988,"developer":"Ocean Software Ltd."},{"name":"Play for Your Life","year":1987,"developer":""},{"name":"Play it Again","year":1987,"developer":""},{"name":"Play It Again Sam","year":1986,"developer":"Rubberchip"},{"name":"Play Your Cards Right","year":1986,"developer":""},{"name":"Playdays","year":1993,"developer":""},{"name":"Plot, The","year":1988,"developer":"Odin Computer Graphics Ltd."},{"name":"Plotting","year":1990,"developer":"Taito Corporation"},{"name":"Plummet","year":1984,"developer":""},{"name":"Plus One: Gnasher + Spectipede","year":1985,"developer":""},{"name":"Pneumatic Hammers","year":1987,"developer":"Andromeda Software"},{"name":"Pod","year":1983,"developer":"BB Design"},{"name":"Pogo","year":1983,"developer":"R&R Software"},{"name":"Pogostick Olympics","year":1987,"developer":"Probe Software Ltd."},{"name":"Pole Position","year":1984,"developer":"Namco Limited"},{"name":"Poli Díaz","year":1990,"developer":"Cande Software"},{"name":"Poogaboo: La Pulga 2","year":1991,"developer":"Opera Soft S.A."},{"name":"Pool","year":1983,"developer":""},{"name":"Pool","year":1983,"developer":"CDS Software Ltd"},{"name":"Pop Stars","year":1991,"developer":"Hellenic Software"},{"name":"Popeye","year":1985,"developer":"dk'tronics"},{"name":"Popeye 2","year":1991,"developer":"Bizarre Developments"},{"name":"Popeye 3: WrestleCrazy","year":1992,"developer":"Bizarre Developments"},{"name":"Popeye: The Collection","year":1992,"developer":""},{"name":"Poseidon: Planet Eleven","year":1990,"developer":"PAL Developments"},{"name":"Post Mortem","year":1988,"developer":"Genesis Soft"},{"name":"Postman Pat","year":1989,"developer":"Enigma Variations Ltd."},{"name":"Postman Pat 2","year":1989,"developer":"Enigma Variations Ltd."},{"name":"Postman Pat 3: To the Rescue","year":1992,"developer":"Alternative Software Ltd."},{"name":"Postman Pat's Trail Game","year":1984,"developer":"Micromega"},{"name":"Potsworth & Co.","year":1992,"developer":"Visual Impact"},{"name":"Potty Painter in the Jungle","year":1983,"developer":""},{"name":"Power","year":1985,"developer":"Durell Software Ltd."},{"name":"Power Drift","year":1989,"developer":"SEGA-AM2 Co.
