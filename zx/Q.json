You are armed with a front firing gun as well as the ability to drop bombs. As you destroy the enemy, occasionally a blue helicopter will fly towards you and when shot it will leave behind a icon which increases your firepower, gives a shield, or an extra life. Getting hit by bullets or an enemies vehicle or aircraft loses a life. When all lives are lost then it is game over.

Knowledge of Paradroid is an advantage (not least because it's a splendid game), as most aspects of the game overlap, including the plot, which sets you as the renegade robot KLP-2, armed with experimental technology to attack enemy droids. </p><p>Your task is to deactivate robots, which can be done in a number of ways - shooting them, gaining control of them so as to deactivate them (known as 'grappling') or pushing them off their circuits. Knowing which method to use in each situation can only come from practice. Grappling is done from a separate screen, and involves aiming at the enemy droid's 12 sectors so as to turn at least 7 of them to your colour. When this is done successfully you can harvest some of the droid's components for your own use - a clear grappling victory gives you more chance of these elements being undamaged and usable.</p>"},{"name":"Queen's Footsteps (Collector's Edition), The: All in One","year":2020,"developer":""},{"name":"Queen's Footsteps, The","year":2020,"developer":""},{"name":"Quest Adventure","year":1983,"developer":""},{"name":"Quest for the Golden Eggcup, The","year":1986,"developer":"Smart Egg Software"},{"name":"Quest for the Holy Grail, The","year":1984,"developer":""},{"name":"Quest for the Holy Joystick","year":1984,"developer":"Delta 4 Software"},{"name":"Question of Scruples, A: The Computer Edition","year":1987,"developer":"Sentient Software Ltd."},{"name":"Question of Sport, A","year":1989,"developer":"Elite Systems Ltd."},{"name":"Questprobe: Featuring Human Torch and the Thing","year":1986,"developer":"Adventure International"},{"name":"Quick Draw McGraw","year":1991,"developer":"PAL Developments"},{"name":"Quick Thinking!","year":1983,"developer":"Widgit Software"},{"name":"Quiz Quest","year":1985,"developer":""}]
