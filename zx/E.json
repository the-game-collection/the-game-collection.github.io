The player initially controls a character referred to as \"Commander Jameson\", starting at Lave Station with 100 credits and a lightly armed trading ship called Cobra Mark III. Most of the game consists of traveling to various star systems, trading with their inhabitants, gaining money and reputation. Money can also be gained by other means besides trading; these include undertaking military missions, bounty hunting, asteroid mining, and even piracy. As the player character earns money, he becomes able to upgrade his ships with enhancements such as better weapons, shields, increased cargo capacity, an automated docking system, etc.</p><p>The game utilizes pseudo-3D wire-frame graphics; its world is viewed from a first-person perspective. It has no overarching story, though a race known as Thargoids play the role of antagonists: their ships will often attack the player-controlled ship, forcing the player to engage in space combat. Combat is action-oriented, taking place in the same environment as the exploration. The player must use various weapons the ship is equipped with, as well as manoeuvre the ship, trying to dodge enemy attacks. The player can also choose to attack neutral ships; doing so will decrease the protagonist's reputation, eventually attracting the attention of the galactic police.</p><p><em>Elite</em> is notable for its expansive game world, consisting of eight galaxies and 256 planets. The player is free to travel to any of these planets, provided his ship has enough fuel for the trip (the ship's fuel capacity is limited for a journey to the distance of seven light-years).</p>"},{"name":"Elixir Vitae","year":2013,"developer":""},{"name":"Elven Warrior","year":1989,"developer":"Reflective Designs"},{"name":"Embassy Assault","year":1983,"developer":"International Computers Limited"},{"name":"Emerald Isle","year":1985,"developer":"Level 9 Computing Ltd."},{"name":"Emilio Butragueño ¡Fútbol!","year":1987,"developer":"Topo Soft"},{"name":"Emilio Butragueño 2","year":1989,"developer":"Wise Owl Software"},{"name":"Emilio Sanchez Vicario Grand Slam","year":1989,"developer":"Zigurat Software S.L."},{"name":"Emlyn Hughes Arcade Quiz","year":1990,"developer":""},{"name":"Emlyn Hughes International Soccer","year":1989,"developer":"Audiogenic Software Ltd."},{"name":"Empire Fights Back, The","year":1985,"developer":""},{"name":"Enchanted Cottage, The","year":1988,"developer":""},{"name":"Encyclopedia of War: Ancient Battles","year":1989,"developer":""},{"name":"Endurance","year":1985,"developer":"CRL Group PLC"},{"name":"Enduro","year":1984,"developer":"Activision Inc."},{"name":"Enduro Racer","year":1987,"developer":"SEGA Enterprises Ltd."},{"name":"Endzone","year":1988,"developer":""},{"name":"Energy Warrior + Molecule Man","year":1987,"developer":"Binary Design Ltd."},{"name":"Engineer Humpty","year":1984,"developer":"Artic Computing Ltd"},{"name":"Enigma Force","year":1985,"developer":"Denton Designs"},{"name":"Enlightenment","year":1988,"developer":"Electralyte"},{"name":"Enterprise","year":1987,"developer":"Industrial Concepts & Design"},{"name":"Epyx 21","year":1990,"developer":""},{"name":"Epyx Action","year":1990,"developer":""},{"name":"Equinox","year":1986,"developer":"Mikro-Gen Ltd","url":"zx_Equinox_1986_Mikro_Gen/Equinox_1986_Mikro_Gen.z80","filesize":45770,"score":6.9,"genres":"Action > Side view > Fixed / flip-screen > Puzzle elements > Shooter > Sci-fi / futuristic","desc":"<p>Sury Ani 7 has been a source of mined resources for many a year, but now that it is contaminated, the only way to harvest its bounty is to do so remotely.
