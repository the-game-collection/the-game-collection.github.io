Unfortunately, also insects, like the ants, grew. They regarded humanity as an enemy and are using their organizational talents as a weapon against the intelligence and so-called creative faculties of the human race. Not only the insects grew but also the movements against the killing of insects. The increased pity for insects was directly proportional to their increased size. It also tells about how Albert Renshaw prepared for his journey to find the means to escape. The second chapter is The Book of Flowers by Prof. Dr. K.J.Th.M. Lanuski. It gives a detailed explanation on what you need to identify plants, an in-depth classification of different environmental divisions and illustrated with a number of examples. </p><p>The third chapter is the James Arwell Society’s publication, which among other things describes the Tenins and the Lepries. With all the other mammals extinct, except for certain specialised breeds in zoological gardens, the Tenins, who are similar to Elves, but their moods can change rapidly to become dark and deceitful, and the friendly Lepries, who are characterised by a total lack of physical beauty. They always have looked after the insect farms, and it is probably as a result of this that they are now tolerated by the insect population. Includes drawings by James Arwell and Donald Beamon.
