The game is viewed from a first person perspective and it involves moving around a crosshair and then pressing the fire button when an enemy ship flies past it. The firing is not instant so the player has to anticipate the enemy's position. Space is full of dust clouds that the player's shots won't penetrate and when the enemy ship hides beneath them they have to wait it out. One enemy appears on screen at a time and when killed another will take its place. The game goes on till either the time runs out or the player has used all the 25 shots they have at their disposal. The player can choose between five skill levels and the scoring is dependent on this. Higher skill levels mean faster enemies and less time available. For each enemy shot down the player earns 10 times the skill level.</p>"},{"name":"Galactic Patrol","year":1983,"developer":""},{"name":"Galactic Trooper","year":1983,"developer":""},{"name":"Galactic Warriors + Raceway","year":1984,"developer":""},{"name":"Galakzions","year":1983,"developer":""},{"name":"Galaxian","year":1984,"developer":"Namco Limited"},{"name":"Galaxians","year":1982,"developer":""},{"name":"Galaxy Force II","year":1989,"developer":"Sega R&D1"},{"name":"Galivan","year":1986,"developer":"Nichibutsu"},{"name":"Galletron","year":1987,"developer":"Remote Programming"},{"name":"Game of Harmony, The","year":1990,"developer":"The Assembly Line"},{"name":"Game Over","year":1987,"developer":"Dinamic Software"},{"name":"Game Over II","year":1987,"developer":"Dinamic Software"},{"name":"Game Set and Match","year":1987,"developer":""},{"name":"Game Set and Match 2","year":1988,"developer":""},{"name":"Games 4","year":1982,"developer":"International Computers Limited"},{"name":"Games Pack 1","year":1982,"developer":""},{"name":"Games, The: Summer Edition","year":1989,"developer":"Epyx Inc."},{"name":"Games, The: Winter Edition","year":1988,"developer":"Epyx Inc."},{"name":"Gandalf the Sorcerer","year":1986,"developer":"Game Gems Inc."},{"name":"Gangsta City","year":2011,"developer":""},{"name":"Gangsters","year":1983,"developer":"P.

If a soldier catches you in a room that is forbidden, you will be placed in solitary confinement. Of course, you have to enter restricted parts of the camp to find items crucial for your escape. The moral flag will turn from green to red to indicate that you are in an area where you shouldn’t be. </p><p>Rule number three: no prisoner may carry forbidden objects. When you are caught in a suspicious situation, you will be stripped of all items that you found so far. To avoid that, you have to deposit objects in a safe place.
