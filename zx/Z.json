You pilot a spacecraft through the levels, shooting as many of the encroaching meanies and mounted turrets as possible. Power-up tokens are offered for shooting some, which can be used to obtain better weapons including ground-attack lasers, speed ups and multiple bullets. Extra lives are on offer as well, which you'll certainly need, especially as you have to go back a long way when losing a life.</p>"},{"name":"Zythum","year":1986,"developer":""},{"name":"Zzoom","year":1983,"developer":"Imagine"},{"name":"Zzzz","year":1986,"developer":""}]
