The player controls one of those robots through ten stages in which a lot of aliens and a big boss want to be defeated. </p><p>This is a traditional \"run and gun\" game in which the player dodges enemy attacks and uses a variety of weapons which are built in the robot's body parts. It is also possible to float for a short amount of time, but this costs energy which is displayed in one of the two automatically regenerating status bars at the bottom of the screen. The other one shows the condition of the protective shields which are decreased by enemy hits. If it runs out, the robot loses a limb and associated systems, e.g. if the head is gone, the radar which shows the direction of incoming attacks goes with it. If all limbs are lost, the game is over. Defeating enemies rewards points which can be used to upgrade the robot's abilities between levels.</p>"},{"name":"Victory Run","year":1987,"developer":"Hudson Soft Company, Ltd.","url":"f#Victory%20Run%20%28USA%29.zip","filesize":106947,"score":6,"genres":"Racing / Driving > Behind view > Direct control > Automobile","desc":"<p><em>Victory Run</em> is an arcade racer based on the Paris-Dakar rally.

It features an anonymous tough hero that roams the streets to beat up The Rogues gang that kidnapped his girlfriend Maria. The game offers five distinct locations, such as city streets and a junkyard, with many different thugs with different strengths. You fight with your fists, feet and a chain, with a regular stance, crouched and jumping attacks. Each level features an end boss which requires a specific tactic in order to progress. Enemies keep spawning continuously from the left and the right side of the screen until the boss is reached, so a steady pace forward is required to reach the end of the level before time runs out. When enemies come too close they will grab the character and quick presses left and right are need to set him free, as he is then vulnerable to incoming attacks.</p>"},{"name":"Volfied","year":1989,"developer":"Taito Corporation","url":"g#V/Volfied%20%28JP%29.pce","filesize":393216,"score":7.6,"genres":"Action > Puzzle > Top-down > Fixed / flip-screen > Arcade > Sci-fi / futuristic","desc":"<p>The space ship Monotros has returned after receiving an SOS call to save his home world (<em>Volfied</em>) from alien invaders and has to defeat a different boss and his minions in each level. <em>Volfied</em> is very similar to Qix -- the player takes control of a ship/object whose purpose is to roam the screen, forming shapes and removing them from the playfield. By way of reward, a picture is gradually revealed in the removed areas of the screen. The borders of the area not yet cleared by the player become the borders of the area the player's pointer can move along. When not cutting, the ship is protected by a shield that decreases over time. When it hits zero, the enemies can also killl you when not cutting.</p><p>The player's object must avoid contact with any of the enemies which float around the screen, as this will weaken and eventually destroy it. Barriers limit which parts of the border boxes can be formed through. The goal is to clear 80% or more of the screen, and each additional percent adds bonus points. Most levels contain power-up blocks that can be claimed when the area around it is removed. Possible power-ups can increase speed (S), freeze the enemies for a short time (T), prevent the shield from counting down for a little while (P), give a laser to shoot the smaller enemies (L), kill all the smaller enemies instantly (C) or grant a weapon to kill the boss (a red tomato only found in blocks with the red light).</p><p>This game allows for one- or two-player games in three difficulty levels, but offers no passwords or saved games across its numerous levels.</p>"}]
