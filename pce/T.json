Energy decreases during the course of a match and describes how much power an athlete has left. There are also three different defense tactics (one-on-one defense, zone defense or a mix between the two) which can be set before the match or during interceptions.</p><p>During the matches, the player controls the ball carrier when in offense and manually switches between athletes when in defense. Passes can be performed in a high or low variation. While most of the match is shown in a slightly heightened side-scrolling perspective, the game switches to a close-up view during a penalty throw or a dunking try. Here the player needs to press a button at the correct timing for a successful throw. When a defense athlete is nearby during a during maneuver, he has the opportunity to block the ball when the correct timing is met.</p>"},{"name":"Tennis Cup","year":1991,"developer":"Loriciel SA"},{"name":"Thunder Blade (J)","year":1990,"developer":"SEGA Enterprises Ltd.","url":"g#T/Thunder%20Blade%20%28JP%29.pce","filesize":524288,"score":6.7,"genres":"Action > Behind view > Top-down > Shooter > Direct control > Helicopter","desc":"<p>Aboard the lethal Gunship Gladiator helicopter, it is your job to ensure that a coup fails to install a dictator as leader. </p><p>The game features 12 levels split into three distinct styles.
