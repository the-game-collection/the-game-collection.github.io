The humans' battle against the bio-computer GAMP continues, with new pilots rising to the challenge and doing their best to protect the Earth.</p><p>The game consists of two modes, entitled <em>Arcade</em> and <em>Fardraut</em>. The Arcade mode is the same as the <em>Recon</em> mode in <em>Xevious: Fardraut Saga</em>, being a port of the original arcade Xevious. The Fardraut mode is composed of four stages, featuring familiar South American backgrounds. Unlike most <em>Xevious</em> games, the player takes control of the aircraft Solvalou only in the third stage; the first two ones are played controlling two different, smaller ships, each possessing properties similar to the Solvalou: rapid fire against air enemies, and bombs dropped on ground structures.</p>"}]
