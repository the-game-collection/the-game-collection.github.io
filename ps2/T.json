Strategy can be applied to CPU controlled players, for example making spell-casters attack a specific enemy or ordering them to stay behind the front-lines. An alternate way to heal characters is to cook. This is based on the specific character's skill to cook and the ingredients used.</p><p>Most of the game is spent, like most RPGs, in towns, dungeons, towers, sprawling world maps, and of course combat. Battles in <em>Tales of Symphonia</em> are fought in real-time. Only four members of your party can participate, each with unique fighting styles. As the game progresses, you are not restricted to only using Lloyd, all major characters are playable which allows you to switch your gaming style. Basic physical attacks are carried out with the A button and pushing the control stick in various directions. The B button is used for special physical attacks and casting spells. Often these special attacks can be linked from a basic physical attack to Special Attacks in progressing levels of 1-3. During a battle you run in a straight line and are able to jump over enemies. In Multiplayer up to 3 more players may partake in battles with you.</p>"},{"name":"Tales of the Abyss","year":2005,"developer":"Namco Tales Studio Ltd.","url":"sony_playstation2_t/Tales%20of%20the%20Abyss%20%28USA%29.zip","filesize":3308262596,"score":7.7,"genres":"Role-playing (RPG) > 3rd-person (Other) > Anime / Manga > Action RPG > Fantasy","desc":"<p><em>Tales of the Abyss</em> is the story of Luke fon Fabre's unintentional journey outside of his mansion, which he has been locked inside of for the last several years, since he was found in an abandoned castle after an kidnapping attempt, with no recollection of his past.

It does away with the heavy strategy and planning elements the series was known for on the PC and offers an experience more focused on the first-person action. The game features 14 single-player levels (15 in the PS2 and GameCube versions). In each, the player controls Domingo 'Ding' Chavez, who leads a team of three other Rainbow operatives. Goals in each mission include taking out terrorists, defusing bombs and protecting hostages. Ding's squad mates will act on their own in supporting the mission, but they can also be given specific orders through a context-sensitive menu: holding position, advancing, clearing a room or defusing a bomb. It's also possible to give delayed orders which are only carried out once a special signal is given. The Xbox version features voice recognition: team orders can be given through a headset.</p><p>Before each mission, each squad member must be equipped with a primary and secondary weapon plus further equipment. More than two dozen realistic firearms are available, and there are also different types of grenades (hand-thrown or fired through a launcher), charges and mines, as well as a gas mask. Thermal and night vision are always available and don't require special equipment.</p><p>Despite the action focus, the game still opts for a certain amount of realism: there is no running or jumping, more than a few hits are fatal and there is no way to regain lost health.</p><p>Besides the single player campaign, there is also the custom mission mode, which allows the player to hunt terrorists on unlocked maps from the campaign.</p><p>The multiplayer modes include:</p><ul><li>Cooperative campaign mode</li><li>Cooperative custom mission mode</li><li>Sharpshooter mode: a timed deathmatch with respawning, the player with the most kills wins.</li><li>Survival mode: no respawns, the last player standing wins.</li><li>Team Survival mode: no respawns, the last team standing wins.</li></ul><p>Multiplayer features vary between platforms: The GameCube doesn't have the competitive modes, PS2 only supports six players online instead of the Xbox' sixteen, and both coop modes are only available via split screen on PS2 and GameCube.</p>"},{"name":"Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six: Lockdown","year":2005,"developer":"Red Storm Entertainment, Inc.","url":"PS2_COLLECTION_PART26/Tom%20Clancy%27s%20Rainbow%20Six%20-%20Lockdown%20%28Europe%29%20%28En%2CFr%2CDe%2CEs%2CIt%29.zip","filesize":3503240833,"score":7,"genres":"Action > 1st-person > Shooter > Tactical shooter","desc":"<p><em>Lockdown</em> is the third Rainbow Six game to appear on the consoles, this time with Red Storm Entertainment fully behind the wheel.

The player takes on the role of Sam Fisher, an operative for the secret organization NSA Black Operation, part of the U.S. government. The organization deals with very sensitive missions, often taken on by a Third Echelon splinter cell division Fisher is part of. His missions are so discreet, that if he is captured the government will deny any such existence of that organization.</p><p>To get around and reach his objectives, Fisher has a variety of moves at his disposal. He can walk, run, crouch, jump, rappel, shimmy, cross horizontal wires, zip using a zip cord, and do a split jump. There are different approaches to taking out enemies. He can use weapons, but the noise might alert guards and that generally makes it more difficult to complete missions. Opponents can be stunned, killed, or subdued. Fisher can for instance jump down from the ceiling and knock an opponent unconscious. Some enemies are needed to activate a door or passcode. Therefore enemies can be taken hostage by holding a gun to their head. They can also be interrogated or be used as human shields.</p><p>Other features include the ability to peak through a door before going through or use an optic cable camera (a \"snake\" camera) to peer through the underside, to check what is ahead. As the focus is on stealth, the amount of weapons is rather small. There is an FN F2000 assault rifle that can be fitted with a silencer and other modifications, and there is a suppressed FN Five-Seven pistol. Ammo is limited and additional bullets are scarce. Players are encouraged to avoid danger by sneaking through shadows and hiding behind objects. Fisher has access to a light meter to check how visible he is, and night vision as well as thermal goggles to see in the dark and view warmer temperatures in colour. Other weapons are ring airfoil projectiles, gas grenades and sticky shockers.</p><p>The Xbox version is the original one, with a closely adapted version for the PC, and separate ports for PS2 and GameCube. The latter have slight changes in levels generally to make it a little easier. Each version also contains some exclusive features. The Xbox and PC versions include three additional downloadable missions (Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell: Mission-Pack). The PS2 version has an exclusive level, and the GameCube version can be connected with a Game Boy Advance through a link cable to view an overhead map. The PS2 and GameCube versions include additional binocular items, and the latter also has an extra sticky bomb weapon. The PS2 release also has an exclusive 5min pre-rendered intro cinematic with full orchestrated score, showing how the two agents you are sent to look for at the beginning of the game were captured.</p>"},{"name":"Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell Trilogy","year":2009,"developer":""},{"name":"Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell: Chaos Theory","year":2005,"developer":"Ubisoft Entertainment Inc.","url":"sony_playstation2_t/Tom%20Clancy%27s%20Splinter%20Cell%20-%20Chaos%20Theory%20%28Europe%2C%20Australia%29%20%28En%2CFr%2CDe%29.zip","filesize":3336028675,"score":8.2,"genres":"Action > Behind view > Stealth > Direct control > Asia > North America > Spy / espionage > Licensed","desc":"<p>Set in the not too distant future, Japan creates the Information Self-Defense Force (I-SDF).

Throughout this time, Japan uncovers more and more information that the infamous Black Gold Day was caused by intentional information warfare attacks.

Fisher has some new moves this time around, and he also has a new weapon always at his disposal; a combat knife. Utilizing the knife, Sam can either kill his enemies, or simply knock them out. At the end of each mission, the player is given an overview of how they did. The more people that the player spares, the better the success score.</p><p>The single-player game is more open-ended than the past two Splinter Cell games. While players are still forced through some areas in a \"tunnel\" like fashion, with no choice of where to go, there are many instances where they can decide how they'd like to get there. For example, in the caverns, one can either kill two enemies and cross the bridge, or leave them alone, sneak along the side path, and climb a ladder at the end, bypassing the fight entirely, but still winding up in the same location.</p><p>Throughout the game many different locations are visited, such as a lighthouse, a Japanese tea house, Seoul, New York City during an East Coast blackout, and other such exotic locales.</p><p>The Spies-vs-Mercs multiplayer mode that appeared in the previous game has returned, with some new features.

One of the new tricks associated with this is the Acid Drop, which can launch you off an opposing pipe, allowing you to pull off 1080's and up.</p><p>Also new to THUG is the ability to drive certain vehicles, like a gardener's truck, a sports car, or a leaf blower.

The game includes 15 events scattered on 8 disciplines: Alpine Skiing (Downhill, Super G, Giant Slalom and Slalom), Ski Jump (Normal and Large hill), Speed Skating (500m, 1000m and 1500m), Women's Biathlon, Nordic Combined, Bobsled (Womens' 2 and Mens' 4), Luge and Cross Country. All venues were modelled after their real counterparts.</p><p>Gameplay, as expected, requires more reflexes than the button-bashing of their Summer counterparts. Alpine Skiing is a matter of skill and quick reflexes, as the player, other than set the direction, only has to choose when to crouch to gain speed (mostly in Downhill and Giant Slalom) and when to carve the snow for sharper turns (either to correct a bad trajectory or approach a tighter gate). These events are based on a simplified version of the engine that power <em>Ski Alpin 2006</em>, also by 49Games. Unlike most other games that feature alpine skiing, the penalty for missing gate depends on the difficulty level chosen: on easy, six misses are allowed, three in medium and none on hard, each carrying a time penalty that depending on how well the player did can just affect the total score or mean losing a medal.</p><p>Ski Jump (also a simplified version of another game, RTL Skispringen 2006) requires the player to keep the balance while descending the hill, jumping at the correct time, counter the effect of the wind in the athletes' balance for maximum distance and then land in perfect telemark fashion.</p><p>Cross Country and Biathlon are relaxed disciplines where all that counts is keeping the best trajectory possible while looking out for straight paths that can be used for short sprints and downhill slopes that can be done while crouching, which allows greater speeds and lower fatigue accumulated from sprints and more hasty climbs. Biathlon is pretty much the same as Cross Country, except it also includes two shooting sessions, with the steadiness of the aim affected by the fatigue levels.</p><p>Skating disciplines require a strong, well timed start, and then accurate button pressing as the skater makes each step. Bobsled and Luge are similar with only two differences: The startup in Bobsled is done by following the on-screen cues and press up on the right time and other than setting the direction, it's also possible to make minimal path changes. The winner is the fastest competitor after two heats (instead of the official four).</p><p>Nordic Combined is a Large hill ski jump which sets the start time for each competitor in the Cross country section.</p><p>It's possible to compete in all 15 or just 9 events, or even create your own competition, with up to four competitors. At each competition the players aim for both medals and the score table, based on the results on each individual event. However, the challenge does not stop with winning medals. The player can unlock additional strips by completing challenges, such as hitting all 10 targets in Biathlon, having a perfect Bobsled start, winning a gold medal and beat each top record on every event or not missing a single step on Speed Skating. The difficulty level affects events differently: in Alpine skiing, it means CPU-controlled players are faster and fewer gate misses are allowed, in Ski jump wind can appear from any direction and in Speed skating, in addition to set the pace, the player also has to steer the athlete to keep her in the best path.</p>"},{"name":"Torrente 3: The Protector","year":2006,"developer":"Virtual Toys, S.L.","url":"PS2_COLLECTION_PART26/Torrente%203%20-%20The%20Protector%20%28Europe%29.zip","filesize":3858450580,"score":4.8,"genres":"Action > 1st-person > 3rd-person (Other) > Shooter > Adult > Licensed","desc":"<p>\"APATRULLANDO LA CIUDAD\"</p><p><em>Torrente</em> has returned, both in film form and as a video game.
