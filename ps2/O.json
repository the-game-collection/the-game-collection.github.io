For those who were poor, the situation didn't improved one bit, and for the richer, maintaining the status was done at the expense of their privacy and personal freedoms.

Combined with the limited availability of clips, this adds a strategic element to the game, as the player can only carry a weapon at a time, so if a powerful weapons runs out of ammo, the player must choose between keeping the weapon and fight hand to hand with the enemies until Konoko finds fresh ammo clips, or discard it for a lesser gun that uses different ammo. However, if the player runs out of ammo completely when facing a tough challenge, Konoko can \"overdose\" on hypo sprays (used to heal damage) by using them over her natural health bar, which provides her with faster movement and tougher blows.</p>"},{"name":"Onimusha 2: Samurai's Destiny","year":2002,"developer":"Capcom Production Studio 2","url":"PS2_COLLECTION_PART18/Onimusha%202%20-%20Samurai%27s%20Destiny%20%28Europe%29%20%28En%2CFr%2CDe%2CEs%2CIt%29.zip","filesize":3767406733,"score":8,"genres":"Action > 3rd-person (Other) > Survival horror > Fantasy > Japan (Ancient/Classical/Medieval) > Martial arts","desc":"<p>Ten years after the lone swordsman, Samanosuke, rose up against an army of demon warriors, Nobunaga's evil campaign continues to wreak havoc across feudal Japan.
