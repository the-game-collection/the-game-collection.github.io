The player navigates a party of characters (up to three active combatants) over pre-rendered backgrounds. Combat with regular enemies occurs randomly. During battles, characters use regular attacks or cast spells. In addition to the regular health (HP) and magic points (MP), each character also has a special SP (\"sanity points\") bar.

There are no enemies or hazards in the game world outside of the colossi battles. After a colossus has been found, a large-scale battle begins.

After having fought his way to the roof, the studentwitnesses the Conception - a colossal destruction of the city, which destroys the world as we know it.

He must communicate with the demonic inhabitants of this horrifying realm, find out what happened to his classmates, and ultimately shape the future of the world.</p><p><em>Shin Megami Tensei III: Nocturne</em> is the third installment in the main series of the <em>Megami Tensei</em> universe. The game retains many traditional elements of the series. Like in the previous entries, the player navigates a character over a large map of a post-apocalyptic city, accessing and exploring complex, maze-like dungeons, which are viewed from a third-person perspective in this installment. Enemy encounters are random, and combat is turn-based. Demon conversation and fusion features from the previous games have been preserved, and function similarly. The player may opt for engaging in a dialogue with demons during the battle, selecting responses and recruiting the demon into the party if it is pleased by them. Demons can be then fused in specific locations to create more powerful ones.</p><p>The active party includes four characters, as opposed to six in the previous games in the series, and contains no human characters whatsoever. Being a demon himself, the protagonist does not use weapons; instead of equipping armor, he ingests symbiotic creatures known as Magatama. Various types of Magatama affect the hero's parameters, strengths and weaknesses to particular elements or attack types, and teach him magic and special abilities. When the protagonist levels up, the player can manually increase his parameters. Leveling up also allows the hero to learn the abilities contained within the Magatama. Once an ability is learned, a different Magatama can be equipped, but the player can still retain the mastered ability and use it in battles. The hero can use up to eight different abilities in a battle.</p><p>A new feature called \"Press Turn\" has been added to the combat system. Each demon has certain resistances, immunities, and weaknesses to different elements or attack types. By using an ability of a type that the enemy is weak to, the player not only inflicts extra damage, but also gains an additional turn. These turns can be used in succession by continuously exploiting enemy weaknesses; naturally, enemies can do the same to player-controlled characters. This feature shifts combat challenge to tactical preparations and memorization of enemy properties, and encourages creation of balanced parties with a varied arsenal of abilities.</p><p>The Law and Chaos ideologies and alignments are absent from this installment.

Look Targeting simply assigns a particular enemy as the center of the camera and can be switched between at any time. The player must still maneuver near the enemy and target them with the cross hairs in order to fire on them. Depending on the secondary weapon selected, players can roll the cross hairs over the wing leader of an enemy group or the sequentially lead gun on a battleship, allowing the player to instantly target multiples from that group.</p><p>The primary weapon of each airplane is a machine gun which fires straight ahead. More destructive secondary weapons are also available, and include Fireworks Missiles which create area explosions, Dog Missiles which slow and/or immobilize targets and Cross Missiles which stick to targets and need to be shot by a machine gun to detonate. Copain also has his own weapon, the Pumpkin Bomb which is a big destructive bomb. These secondary weapons are automatically replenished with the destruction of chains of enemies and/or combos. Chains/Combos are also the way to activate score multipliers, which affect the amount of money won in each mission. Ciel, Copain and Femme are continually in competition throughout the game and often bonuses (such as faster engines) are given to the character with the highest score in specific missions.

The story moves quickly after Charlie Brown is captured by the Red Baron's minions along with the plans for a secret weapon that could change the course of the war.

Collectible items in the world unlock plane and weapon upgrades, as well as new character/plane combinations for use in versus multiplayer aerial combat.

You play Maia, who is the incarnate of the goddess Laharah and the powerful Queen of the realm of Halassar. Unlike Joseph’s kinship, Maia’s people worship Laharah as a benevolent creator. Maia was born with the mark of prophecy, her fate being written in the Book of Prophecy. From the beginning, she has welcomed her destiny and knows that she must fulfill the prophecy. What is unknown to her is the path she must follow to do so.</p><p><em>Summoner 2</em> abandons the combo-based real-time combat of the predecessor and is more action-oriented, with the player directly controlling the physical attacks of the main character. Instead of summoning creatures to fight side-by-side with Maia, she actually becomes the demon when it is summoned. Three characters can be part of Maia’s party at one time and AI scripts can be assigned to each. Different characters are introduced as the story progresses and Maia’s skills improve. It is also possible to choose to adventure in “solo-mode”, leaving the party members behind to go on alone.</p>"},{"name":"Sunny Garcia Surfing","year":2001,"developer":"Krome Studios Pty Ltd.","url":"PS2_COLLECTION_PART25/Sunny%20Garcia%20Surfing%20%28Europe%29%20%28En%2CFr%2CDe%29.zip","filesize":407805141,"score":6.7,"genres":"Sports > 3rd-person (Other) > Surfing > Licensed","desc":"<p>Building upon the gameplay featured in Krome's Championship Surfer, <em>Sunny Garcia Surfing</em> is an updated and improved surfing simulation that takes you to twelve locales where you will ride the ocean's wild waves.</p><p>Choose to control one of eight celebrity surfers (Sunny Garcia, Tim Reyes and Rochelle Ballard among others) to surf at world-famous beaches.

Although they are human, Fiel and Dorothy can tap into their world's magical power, Etheria. Toto, their special cat, is able to transform itself into a sword.

Gameplay includes exploration of the world in a free-roaming style, conversations with NPCs and party members. Objects and animals in the environment can be destroyed to find valuable items.
