While the graphics and especially the athletes are not at all realistic, the game still has a strong focus on statistics and the simulation aspect. For example the tactics of each athlete can be changed in detail, there are about 75 skills which change the athletes' abilities and there is extensive statistical tracking for the player's performance as well. On the field the game uses relatively simple two button controls, e.g. swinging is a matter of positioning the bat in the strike zone and hitting a button. The Wii version features limited motion controls, but only in exhibition matches and home run derby.</p><p>Success mode is the heart of the game: in this mode the player creates a single athlete and follows his way to the top. During this mode the player needs to choose how to utilize the given time, for example with different training exercises. Training eventually awards a level-up and the possibility to improve statistical values. However, there is also the personal life to take care of (which also affects other statistics such as popularity). This is especially important during the first three years when the player character is still in college: here a significant portion of time has to be spent with studying (failing college will end the career early!) or with a part-time job for money. The earned pay can be spent on items (e.g. to restore vitality which limits what can be achieved in a day) or better equipment. At some points there are special events where the player has to make decisions (e.g. answering a request from the girlfriend or the offer to become the team's captain). However, the available options are limited by the available fate cards - for example, two \"yes\" cards result in the option to answer \"yes\" twice.</p><p>The other playing modes are more traditional: exhibition (a single match), practice, league (with up to six teams), season (the player comes the general manager of a team for ten years) and home derby. There is also a shop where the player can purchase baseball cards (report cards of the included licensed MLB athletes) with Power Major Points. Those are earned after certain game events, e.g. playing an exhibition match or completing success mode.

Next to a singleplayer mode, the game can also be played online. You can have a hunting party of up to four people, and once you start to go after larger prey, you'll definitely need them all. Every couple of weeks, Capcom organizes online missions. While some are harder than others, they all allow you the chance to create equipment you'd never be able to get if you only played offline.</p><p>Thankfully, you won't be fighting with your bare hands. When you first begin your game, you are given a simple sword and shield, but as you complete missions and harvest materials from both the creatures you kill and various nooks and crannies in the environments, you can begin to craft stronger weapons and armor for yourself. On top of that, you can also use berries, plants, shells and more to craft healing items, stat boosters and even ammunition if you opt to use a bowgun.</p><p>There are several weapon types in Monster Hunter, including the bowgun (perfect for group support and long-range attacks), Great Swords (huge and slow, but very powerful and a great reach), and even Hammers (The most powerful weapon class, but cannot block). Most weapons can even be upgraded once you create them, allowing you to add damage, sharpness and even elemental attributes.</p><p>The game is played out through missions you take from the Hunter's Guild (or the village elder if you're playing solo), and these missions range from material gathering, to egg stealing, and even live capture. Combat is all real-time. The left analog stick moves your hunter while the right stick is actually used for attacking. Different directions on the stick trigger different types of attacks, even allowing for some simple combos.</p><p>The story in Monster Hunter is a very basic one. You want to be the best Hunter ever, so you go out to prove yourself. That's really all there is to it.</p>"},{"name":"Monster Hunter 2","year":2006,"developer":"Capcom Co., Ltd.","url":"sony_playstation2_m_part2/Monster%20Hunter%202%20%28Japan%29.zip","filesize":2443111588,"score":"","genres":"Action > Behind view > Real-time > Hunting > Direct control > Fantasy","desc":"<p><em>Monster Hunter 2</em> (where \"2\" is pronounced as Spanish number \"dos\") is a hunting action game.
