Can a world-saving quest help this obnoxious 16-year-old grow into a respectable human being?</p><p><em>Radiata Stories</em> is a lighthearted and humorous fantasy role-playing game from Square Enix. You control Jack as he travels from town to town, recruiting allies and taking on menial tasks. Of course there's also a plot of saving the kingdom from certain doom, but there's plenty of time for exploring and meeting people before you'll need to worry about that. The game is fairly open-ended, allowing players to explore at their leisure.</p><p>Unlike the usual RPG, where the NPC characters simply wait around for the player to come listen to their one sentence, everyone in <em>Radiata Stories</em> has their own life. People wake up, go places and do things, then go back home. Learning the characters' schedules and using them to Jack's advantage is critical to a successful adventure. Sometimes they're too busy to stop and talk to you, so you have to catch them at the right time. This makes Radiata feel less like a game and more of a living, breathing world.</p><p>Combat is real-time, much like Star Ocean: Till the End of Time and Namco's Tales series, but you can give general guidelines for the NPC party members on how they should operate.

As a result, battles continued in different ways and Russian forces were more instrumental in the eventual defeat of Japan. The end of the war has had Japan divided between the allied forces, similar to Germany. Japan is now split into a communist North Japan and an Democratic South Japan, governed separately. Without any obvious cause, Japan erupted into civil war between it's halves for four years. Dubbed the \"Japan War\", it further weakened Japan's economy and fueled resentment between people living in the North and the South. In 1964, Masami von Weizegger is a AFW pilot in the South Japan forces. While field testing a prototype AFW, it is stolen by North Japanese agents and Masami is dispatched to recover the stolen material. As Masami's team attempts to retrieve the AFW, they stumble into a military operation that threatens to erupt into all-out war.</p><p><em>Ring of Red</em> is a turn-based strategy game set in an alternative post-World War II Japan. Players take the role of members of the South Japan military who are put on a hunt for a stolen AFW. During battles, mechs are moved into position on a grid-based map and may engage different enemy units or occupy specific points. As turns are taken, time passes, shifting the battlefield through daytime and nighttime hours as well as different weather effects. All of these affect the accuracy of weapons as well as the types of abilities that can be used. Battles end when objectives are met by either side.</p><p>Putting a twist on the turn-based genre, <em>Ring of Red</em> features turn-based movements with real-time combat. When two AFWs engage on the battle grid, players are taken to a real-time battle where they have limited time to engage one another before refueling is required. Here the AFW is viewed from 3rd person and may be moved forward and back and given orders. The AFW uses a steam powered cannon which must be pressurized before firing, aiming at either an enemy AFW or at enemy support crew. Accuracy increases continuously while in aiming mode, and the player may then issue a fire command, which launches an attack with the current accuracy shown on-screen. Additionally AFWs can engage in close combat if they are close enough, delivering punches to one another. Each AFW pilot also has his own statistics and own special abilities, that can be used only once per battle, that can be called upon at any time. AFWs also feature unique statistics, being divided into four types: Standard, Light, 4-Leg (Heavy) and Anti-AFW. </p><p>Each AFW unit is actually a group made up of three ground units: one of which acts as crew for the AFW, while the other two walk alongside. Support units are divided into types including: Infantry, Shooter, Supply, Medical, Mechanic and Recon. Each of these types of \"support units\" has different skills in battle and individually have different abilities and statistics. The abilities available and used change depending on which positions the units are assigned to. Additionally many special abilities need to \"charge\" in the rear ranks before becoming available for usage. These abilities include firing special types of munitions (including flash, heat, smoke and impact), laying down mines or tripwire, laying down a barrage of fire, throwing grenades, healing units, sniping specific targets, morale boosts, AFW repairs, neutralization of enemy effects and disarming enemy mines/tripwire.</p>"},{"name":"Rise of the Kasai","year":2005,"developer":"BottleRocket Entertainment, Inc.","url":"sony_playstation2_r/Rise%20of%20the%20Kasai%20%28USA%29.zip","filesize":2611437103,"score":7.1,"genres":"Action > 3rd-person (Other) > Beat 'em up / brawler > Stealth > Direct control","desc":"<p>Rau, the hero of The Mark of Kri, has fallen in battle.

The Japanese army is attempting a military takeover, groups of them have declared martial law and are riding around in robots called Bullets to enforce it. The government doesn't want to launch an all out counter attack because that would result in massive civilian casualties. Instead they turn to Professor Matsuzakai who developed the Bullet machines and a handful of people at the Odaiba Bullet repair site. With major Kazuma Saeki in charge Operation Velvet is launched, with only four operational experimental machines at their disposal they must stop the rebellion in seven days otherwise an all out attack will be launched against the rebel forces in Tokyo with corresponding catastrophic loss of life and massive damage.</p><p>The game starts with a long conversation between the chief cabinet secretary, the head of the army and the Japanese Prime minister, This sets the scene and introduces all the characters. When this is over the player starts on their first mission. Prior to a mission each of the Bullets can be customised, this includes naming and changing the colour of each machine, assigning weapons to each arm and shoulder, and upgrading body parts. The player also has a number of TP or Technique points which they can use to install battle manoeuvres such as the 'Preparation For Combat' technique which costs three TP and decreases the enemy weapon hit ratio by -20 and the player's hit ratio by -10. Only six techniques can be installed at a time.</p><p>The game consists of eleven missions spread over a seven day period and each mission is turn based. In each turn the player selects whether they wish to move a Bullet in normal mode, just a few adjacent cells, or turbo mode in which they can travel further. While moving they may optionally employ one of the deployed combat techniques. Once the player has set their Bullet's destination they may choose whether or not to attack their opponents, in an attack multiple opponents can be selected.While various battle techniques used by the players and their opponents affect the hit ratio and consequently the damage caused by an attack, other game elements also do this. When firing through obstacles such as cars the hit ratio is halved, if the line of fire passes through two cars it is halved again and nothing gets through three cars. There are also special cells known as obstruction squares which halve the hit rate of any firing line that passes through them. </p><p>When the player has completed the game in Story mode the game changes to Life mode where, the manual states, \"A new stage is formed for every mission, so it is necessary to come up with differing strategies each time.\" In Life mode the player receives prize money for completed missions which they can use to trade for parts and weapons, trading is only available in Life mode.

Other customizations include movements on stage, instruments, and the general physique and appearance in the game. To succeed, players need to reach a set score through their combined performances. Multipliers for playing perfectly are tracked for the individual instruments and there can also be separate difficulty levels.

The second is manual skill development where the player can trade in jewels to upgrade several skills of a character e.g. Longsword, Climbing, Search Chests, etc.</p><p>Character levels are represented by Character Class levels. Certain skills must be upgraded for a character to fulfill the requirements of that class. Each class has different traits, for example a Swordsman gains benefits in attack mode. Character classes do not effect the storyline. </p><ul><li><strong>Turned-based Combat</strong>  </li></ul><p>Standard RPG turn-based combat, where the uniqueness of the combat refers to automatic combo capabilities of your characters. Under certain situations, the player's characters may combine their attacks against an enemy (a combo) thus creating greater effects (in addition of visual effects).</p><p>Characters in combat throughout the course of combat may develop special weapon skills. Weapon skills may only be attained through combat through enlightenment (Glimmer). Weapon skills use BPs (Battle Points) and (sometimes) DPs (Duration Points), each weapon skill has different BPs, which are affected by the skills of a character, e.g. a character that has a level two skill in Longsword uses less BPs for his/her longsword weapon skill.</p><p>Another interesting feature about the weapons in regard to combat: each character may equip up to five weapons (optional) and may choose from those five different weapons at any point during combat, thus adding more tactical possibilities in combat. This reason for this may likely relate to DPs (Duration Points) of a weapon. If a DP of a weapon is used up (usually due to use of special weapon skills), the weapon breaks and is unusable during combat. It may only be repaired at a blacksmith or at an inn. </p><p>Unlike other RPGs, all attributes of the characters (health, etc.) are automatically healed after combat. However, if a character falls during combat, their LPs (Life Points) decrease. If the LP decreases to zero, the character will die permanently. LPs are regained by resting at an inn.</p>"},{"name":"Room Zoom: Race for Impact","year":2004,"developer":"Blade Interactive Studios Ltd.","url":"PS2_COLLECTION_PART20/Room%20Zoom%20-%20Race%20for%20Impact%20%28Europe%29%20%28En%2CFr%2CDe%29.zip","filesize":191301622,"score":"","genres":"Action > Racing / Driving > Behind view > Contemporary","desc":"<p><em>Room Zoom: Race for Impact</em> is an arcade racing game where you race across a house called the Room Zoom manor.</p><p>The game can be played in single player (including a championship), multiplayer and online.

The amount of energy varies in different sections of the level (more when going downhill, less when going up), and releasing the button allows for some regeneration, while the skier will move slower. When overexerting the athlete, the energy levels move into orange and red, and a large amount of stamina is consumed. Other techniques include gliding (crouching when going downhill) and sprinting in certain areas. The shooting sections are shown from a first-person perspective. The accuracy depends on the remaining stamina. Players can also hold their breath to steady the rifle, but this depletes the stamina levels further.</p><p>The different game modes include Practice, Career and Multiplayer.
