You play an orange ball with two legs and a snout. Q*bert is very good at hopping and does so on an isometric grid in the shape of a pyramid.<em>Q*Bert 3</em> takes this simple premise and applies it to varying themes and grid layouts. There are a total of 20 levels with 4 boards per level of increasing difficulty. Happy hopping!</p>"}]
