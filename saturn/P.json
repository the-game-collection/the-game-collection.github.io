Occasionally the player is presented with dialogue choices which may affect the current situation but there is no real branching in the main story, just different reactions by the people addressing you. Voice-acting is almost non-present and appears only in key dialogues between the player and the idols, and usually for no more than a single short sentence. In photo session player can take a limited number of photos but does not control camera movement, instead, camera moves up and down once and the player has the chance to take a photo or keep the movie to use on the next pose. Limited bonus contained in a package is an envelope containing an actual photo from one of the photo sessions in the game.</p>"},{"name":"Pia Carrot e Youkoso!!
