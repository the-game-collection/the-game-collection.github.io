As they and their powers grew, the Black Dragon Vlag, hungry to devour this power and make it his own, began a campaign of assault against the siblings and their kingdom. Together, the Eldean clan was able to defeat Vlag, and with the killing strike were showered in his vile blood and imbibed with immortality. Fargasta ascended into a prosperous age under the leadership of their fabled heroes, but this period of revelry was soon cut short as Radoria began to descend into a madness that stemmed from his claiming of the foul sword Madriker, crafted from the soul of the vanquished Black Dragon. As his madness, and power, grew, he claimed the title of \"Immortal Emperor\" and set about imposing his will upon the lands, destroying all that was pure and crushing any who opposed him and his fiend-sword Madriker. The black tide that had swallowed his soul soon threatened to swallow everything. In a final act of desperation, Cirrus called upon the one power she had hidden from her brothers and transformed herself into the Holy Sword of Eldean, equipping to Estan and allowing him to cast a mighty blow towards Radoria, causing a blast that sent tremors throughout the lands entire. As the dust settled on the battleground, there was to be no trace of any of the Eldean clan; all had vanished, and all the people believed the Legend of Eldean had come to its tragic conclusion.</p><p>Generations of relative peace passed following the fateful battle between the Eldean siblings, but with time the ancient truces that united the land during Radoria's scourge began to unravel. War and unrest began to take root, new agents of evil began to take power and the violence spread out to all corners of the world. Pike, a young boy whose parents were murdered at the outset of this new unrest, while he was still just an infant, awakes one morning in his home in the Harpy Village, where he was taken by Laia, the harpy that found him after his parents' demise. The Harpy Village had managed to remain isolated from the troubles brewing elsewhere until this morning, when it is attacked by a dark, dragon-mounted warrior named Belnard on a ruinous quest to collect all the Power Crystals in the land, one of which is housed in the Harpy Village. During the attack, Laia is petrified by Belnard, forcing Pike to gather his courage and venture forth from the Village. Armed with his father's old magical, talking sword, Cirrus, Pike sets out on a quest to save Laia and all that he holds dear; soon taking up allies that join him on his quest to stop the evil Belnard and the dark forces he works for from conquering the world.</p><p>Players assume the role of Pike as he travels the land, gaining 4 comrades to help in his quest, fighting menu-driven battles and exploring towns and dungeons. The player controls their inventory and party by use of items and magic, equipping of weapons and armor and monitoring the status of party characters. While traveling from town to town or exploring dungeons, the player will be engaged in random encounters by enemies unseen on the screen or overworld. Each character's agility skill determines the order of turns during combat. Battles reach their conclusion when either all of the enemies or all of Pike's party have been depleted of their hit points. Winning a battle nets the player experience points, gold and occasionally an item. Running from a battle is also an option, though this results in nothing gained. If all of the player's party is slain during the battle, the game will be over. The player will come across shops selling items and equipment in each town they come across, at which the player can use gold earned from winning battles or selling outdated equipment to purchase new wares. Magic and skills play a large role in battles, with characters calling upon their stores of MP to utilize them in lieu of standard attacks during battle.</p><p>Albert Odyssey: Legend of Eldean is a standard Japanese-style Turn-Based RPG. Though released on the 32-bit Sega Saturn, it is visually reminiscent of other classic top-down 16-bit SNES RPGs. The extra graphical horsepower is used to make things just a bit crisper, clearer and more vibrant than its predecessors. It also utilizes its fifth-generation capabilities in the form of CD-quality audio for the thoroughly composed soundtrack, and the occasional voiceover, most prominently in the opening intro. Players will take their party of 5 characters through several cities and dungeons, traversing to and from each on a minimal overworld map rife with random encounters. Each character gains experience and levels up independently, with stats gained and spells learned automatically with progression. Combat occurs in typical Turn-Based fashion, with options for each character to attack, use magic, use an item, defend or run. Though power-leveling is easy due to the frequent random encounters, it is not greatly needed thanks to the abundance of boss battles and the high amount of experience gained from winning each one. Through the majority of the game, the highest-caliber weapons and armor are bought from the cities' shops, but the most powerful of these items are found in longer, more complex endgame dungeons. The game is split into 2 chapters, the 2nd taking place a few years after the 1st and building upon a plot thread started in it. </p><p>Legend of Eldean is part of the Albert Odyssey series, with 2 previous Japan-only releases on SNES, although there is no continuation of storyline established in the first 2 Albert Odyssey's in Legend of Eldean, save for a few reference to Albert, the main character of the original, and some of his exploits. Legend of Eldean also differs from the previous entries through its Turn-Based combat, where the first 2 employed a Tactical style. It is not fully known to what extent the translation team at Working Designs stuck to the original Japanese script. Their conversion brings with it many pop-culture references (some timeless, some definitely rooted in the time of release), 4th wall-breaking allusions and humorous punchlines and non-sequiturs; mostly through the brief interactions the player can engage in with NPC townsfolk, but even interjected into the more plot-crucial conversations and events taking place with the fairly large cast of important characters involved, breaking mold with what would have been an otherwise standard fantasy-fare storyline and setting.</p>"},{"name":"Album Club (Mune Kyun): Saint Paulia Jogakuin","year":1997,"developer":"SEGA Enterprises Ltd.","url":"e#Album%20Club%20%28Mune%20Kyun%29%20-%20Saint%20Paulia%20Jogakuin%20%28Japan%29.zip","filesize":445950961,"score":"","genres":"Adventure > 3rd-person (Other) > Fixed / flip-screen > Anime / Manga > Mini-games > Direct control > Japan (Modern/Futuristic) > Sci-fi / futuristic","desc":"<p><em>Album Club: Mune Kyun Saint Paulia Jogakuin</em> is a game set in Japan that tells the story of a young schoolgirl and her robot through several mini-games such as Janken as she progresses through her daily activities, while the robot takes pictures of students for the school album.

There, two gigantic corporations, referred to by the acronyms NONLUN and AZTK, had previously been having an all-out war between them for forty-seven years. The war had involved all possible fronts and theaters, including operations in the air, on the surface of the land and sea, and beneath the water. Very recently, a weak peace accord had only just been reached. In the manual, the peace accord is described as being much like \"a blanket covering the fire that smolders in the hearts of the people. The agreement is sufficiently unsteady that an influential mercenary company, known only as \"the Bureau,\" has now decided to hire a capable battle walker pilot named Gert Staun to restart the war so they can continue to make large amounts of money by taking lucrative contracts from both sides. The player takes the role of Gert Staun.</p><p>Naturally \"the Bureau\" has placed a high priority on this, and they are funding it entirely on their own. Indeed, Gert Staun's battle walker, called the \"Slambird\" is explicitly said to be custom-modified. In particular, the Slambird can not only survive either on land or underwater, but it can transition between the two -- it can move, fight, and safely control its vertical position in either environment. These abilities are portrayed as costly and not standard to such vehicles in the universe where <em>Amok</em> takes place. The transformation of the Slambird between an underwater vehicle and a land vehicle is automatically scripted, however. The player has no power to control this transformation or alter the time when it happens. Instead, the player must get to the point when Staun will automatically bring the Slambird ashore to continue his attacks.</p><p>The object of this arcade-type game is to meet a series of objectives, and to do so in such a way that each side will blame the other. The game has a linear structure, based on levels that present tasks of increasing difficulty, and all sorts of hazards and targets are encountered. These include military bases, power generators, land mines, infantry, tanks, submarines -- even sharks and huge, aggressive birds. Infantry elements are poorly armored, so they can be killed by being run over. In one mission, the only way that the player will be able to get enough time to escape is to open with a surprise attack, slowing pursuit by destroying a parking facility full of unattended troop transport vehicles. Power-ups are scattered throughout the levels. The Slambird carries a variety of explosive devices and line-of-sight weapons. Some of the explosive weapons can bounce in a parabolic trajectory, and in addition there are two laser cannons that can fire rapidly an unlimited number of times. These cannons are useful in case no other weapons remain, and they can be used to create complex ripple fire, which can be used to cover an area that is surprisingly wide. When underwater, propellers are used, while torpedoes are automatically used instead of missiles.</p>"},{"name":"Andretti Racing","year":1996,"developer":"Stormfront Studios","url":"e#Andretti%20Racing%20%28Europe%29.zip","filesize":485730940,"score":7.5,"genres":"Racing / Driving > Simulation > 1st-person > Behind view > Automobile > Track racing > Vehicle simulator > Licensed","desc":"<p>For the first time ever in an arcade racer, take control of either NASCAR or Indy cars and cruise around 16 detailed tracks.

Guns and bombs are levelled-up and collected by dropped power-ups, which are money-themed, with the gun upgrades shown as American dimes and bombs as gold bars.</p><p><em>Gun &amp; Frontier</em> was ported to the Sega Saturn in 1997 and was later included in the cross-platform compilation Taito Legends 2 in 2006.</p>"},{"name":"Arcade Gears Vol. 3: Wonder 3","year":1998,"developer":"Capcom Co., Ltd.","url":"e#Arcade%20Gears%20Vol.%203%20-%20Wonder%203%20%28Japan%29.zip","filesize":476926123,"score":"","genres":"Action > Compilation > Diagonal-down > Side view > Arcade > Platform > Puzzle elements > Shooter > Direct control","desc":"<p><em>Three Wonders</em> contains three different games: <em>Midnight Wanderers</em> (side-scrolling action), <em>Chariot</em> (shoot-em-up) and <em>Don't Pull</em> (puzzle).</p><p><strong>Midnight Wanderers: Quest for the Chariot</strong><em>Midnight Wanderers</em> (<em>Roosters</em> in the Japanese version) is a run-and-gun game. The player walks along side-scrolling stages while shooting enemies with a bow. The player can grab power-ups such as stronger shot, or a companion that follows the avatar and shoots. The gameplay is very similar to Ghosts 'N Goblins, made by the same developer. If the avatar gets hit he loses his clothes and will walk in his underwear in the same way.</p><p><strong>Chariot: Adventure Through The Sky</strong><em>Chariot</em> is a shoot-em-up similar to Gradius. The player shoot enemies on a vertically scrolling screen, collect power-ups and fight end bosses. The player collects power-ups such as three-way shot, stronger laser, extra points, bombs and shields. If the player picks up extra bombs, they attach to his or her ship like a tail. The end bosses are themed after the classic elements, like the wind, the Moon, the sun, etc.</p><p><strong>Don't Pull</strong><em>Don't Pull</em> is essentially a polished and updated version of Pengo. In this single screen game, the player plays as a bunny or chipmunk walking through a maze full of baddies. The player can push the blocks of the maze to crush the enemies.</p><p>If a tile that is pushed is blocked by another tile, it is crushed and clears the way through the maze. There also are special blocks, for example a block with a bomb icon, that explodes and stuns any nearby enemies.

Featuring eight athletes with different abilities and specialties, from the agile Karl Vain and Femi Kadiena, the fast Li Huang and Ellen Reggiani, the well balanced Joe Kudou and Rick Blade to the powerhouses Aleksei Rigel and Jef Jansens, the player must achieve the best scores possible in each event to get to the World's best results table, not only in the decathlon points table but also on the individual events table.</p><p>All events follow the core gameplay of other athletics titles (such as Track &amp; Field), with some changes from event to event. Spriting events such as the 100-meter dash are pure button-bashing, with the 110-Meter Hurdles requiring an additional tap in the action button to pass the athlete at the correct time over the hurdle without losing speed or knocking it down. At the opposite level, the 400-Meter and the 1500-Meter Race add a stamina bar that must be kept above critical levels at all times to keep the athlete fresh until the end, this being done by simply pacing the number of presses done by the player (the 1500M also requires the player to steer the athlete in the best path: as close as possible to the inside edge without hitting other runners or losing speed from going over the edge). Jumping events, along the javelin, require a fast build-up, an well-timed action (be it jump, set the pole or release the javelin), and setting the most appropriate angle. Discus is the only event where button mashing isn't required, and asks the player to rotate the D-pad clockwise to build strenght, followed by a push of the action button to set the angle of release as well as the direction. </p><p>Like in the original ST-V version (which means it is in every way similar to the arcade version), two players can compete at the same time in the running event, and at the 1500M race six drones compete at the same time.</p>"},{"name":"Atlantis: The Lost Tales (Disc 1)","year":1997,"developer":"Cryo Interactive Entertainment","url":"e#Atlantis%20-%20The%20Lost%20Tales%20%28Europe%29%20%28En%2CDe%2CEs%29%20%28Disc%201%29.zip","filesize":578519569,"score":7,"genres":"Adventure > 1st-person > Puzzle elements","desc":"<p>The advanced city design of Atlantis shows that a fully-fledged society must've functioned there, and this adventure game brings it to life.
