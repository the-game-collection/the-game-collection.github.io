Unbreakable adamantium was ingested into his bones, in an attempt to turn him into a \"super-soldier\". For the rest of his life, Logan (who adopted the nickname Wolverine) will have to fight against the beast inside him.

Wolverine mostly uses his most powerful weapon, the adamantium claws, to strike enemies with. With the claws unsheathed, he can enter an even more devastating \"Rage Mode\", achieved after the player repeatedly taps a button. Other abilities include dashing, clinging on walls and ceilings, and sliding to avoid taking falling damage. By pressing down a button, the player can also have the super-hero regenerate his health if he stands still.</p><p>Beside straightforward combat against regular enemies and bosses, the game also features stealth segments, during which Wolverine will have to traverse a stage unnoticed.
