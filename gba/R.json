It is broadly similar to the movie's adaptation for PC, but has its own interpretation of the movie's story and unique level design and gameplay.</p><p>Both the Rugrats and the Thornberrys are stranded on an uninhabited island after a storm wrecked their ship. Players will control Timmy, Eliza and Lil &amp; Phil on their quest to find missing family members. The maze-like island is seen from an overhead view. When another character is found, they usually offer a fetch mission - finding items like fish, magazines, boots, keys, etc. When the item is found and returned, either the path to the next level or a mini-game will open up. Most of the mini-games fall into two categories: a side-scrolling platformer and a top-down racing game. </p><p>In the platformer, the goal is to defeat a number of animals by throwing gooshy balls at them. The balls can be collected both on the main island map as well as in the side-scrolling levels. Once all animals are defeated, a fight against a tougher boss follows. The racing game has varying objectives, like chasing an animal or collecting a number of objects on the track. Once that goal is reached, there is also a boss confrontation: the boss is trying to catch the player and the goal is to keep away from him until a time limit runs out. Completing a mini-game will usually award an item that another character needs.</p><p>Should the player get hurt during a mini-game, glowing balls can be collected to refill the health bar (represented by a milk bottle for the Rugrats and a water bottle for Eliza Thornberry). An overview map of the whole island can be used to quickly move to places already explored. Progress in the game is saved via passwords.</p>"},{"name":"Rugrats: Castle Capers","year":2001,"developer":"Software Creations Ltd.","url":"a#R.zip/R%2FRugrats%20-%20Castle%20Capers%20%28U%29.gba","filesize":1,"score":7.1,"genres":"Action > Side view > Platform > Licensed","desc":"<p><em>Rugrats: Castle Capers</em> is based on the Daytime Emmy-award winning animated television series Rugrats.</p><p>Angelica has claimed herself queen of the castle that Stu Pickles built.
