Like most games of its kind, the backdrop is set in space. The first part of the battle is spent shooting down opposing fighters, snagging more powerful weapons, speed power-ups and fuel. Not only do you have to worry about the enemy, your fuel is working against you as well. The second part of the battle is to grab fuel and take out ground forces through a 3D corridor and dodging walls. The final part of the battle is the end boss.</p>"},{"name":"Zillion","year":1987,"developer":"SEGA Enterprises Ltd.","url":"b#Zillion%20%28Europe%2C%20Brazil%29%20%28Rev%202%29.zip","filesize":76797,"score":7.9,"genres":"Action > Side view > Fixed / flip-screen > Anime / Manga > Metroidvania > Platform > Sci-fi / futuristic > Licensed","desc":"<p>The White Knights, a peacekeeping force of the Planetary System, have a mission: prevent the evil Norsa Empire from dominating the world.
