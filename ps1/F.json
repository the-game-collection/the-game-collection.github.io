The games that can be played in this product are:* Seven In A Row: For four players. All cards are dealt and players take turns playing a card, the first player to play all their cards wins. Cards are played sequentially by suit and each suit starts with the seven and builds both up to the king and down to the ace. The game is played in levels, to progress to the next level the player must finish either first of second on a five round match. To complete level four the player must finish first.</p><ul><li>The Rich Man: Players take it in turn to play a card, the card they play must be higher than the card played by the previous player. The first player to play all their cards wins. At the end of the first round the winning player is termed 'The Millionaire', the second player is 'Rich', the third player is 'Poor' and the fourth player is 'Destitute'. 'Destitute' must give their two best cards to 'The Millionaire', 'Poor' must give their best card to 'Rich'. Millionaire and 'Rich' must give cards to Destitute' and 'Poor' but they can give any cards they wish. Under certain conditions card strength is reversed which affects the game dramatically. Players start with twenty points and gain or lose points depending on how well they do, and they complete a level by finishing first in a ten round match.</li><li>Splash: Players play card(s) to match the value of the card on the table, the first player to play all their cards wins. They win instantly (i.e. The 'Splash') if the total value of their hand matches the table card. The game is a variation on 'Crazy Eights' as it has similar special cards. Eight's change the suit of the next player's discard, Jack's cause the next player to miss a turn, Ten's reverse the order of play and Two's make the next player pick up two additional cards from the deck. To clear a level the player must finish in the top two of a ten round match.</li><li>Page One: is another Crazy Eight variant. Players play card(s) to match the value of the card on the table, the first player to play all their cards wins. The special cards in this game are Eight's which change the suit of the next player's discard, Jack's which cause the next player to miss a turn, Queen's which reverse the order of play and Two's which make the next player pick up two additional cards from the deck. A further twist is that when a player holds just one card they must press triangle, if they don't they are required to pick an additional five cards from the deck. To clear a level the player must finish in the top two of a ten round match.</li><li><p>Seven Bridges: Players are dealt cards and take turns exchanging one card from their hand with a card from the deck. When they have three cards of the same value or three cards of the same suit they can place them on the 'table'. Cards can also be added to sets and sequences laid by other players. The first person to dispose of all their cards wins. Players start with points and lose points for every card remaining their hand when a round is over. <br>To clear a level the player must finish in the top two after a ten round match. To complete level four they must finish top.</p></li><li><p>Old Maid/Old Man: These are two variations on the same game. Old Maid is played with a fifty two card deck and one joker. Cards are discarded in pairs and the first person to dispose of all their cards wins. Old Man is played the same way but one card is removed from the fifty two card deck. In both games playing a Jack's causes the next player to miss a turn while Queen's reverse the order of play.</p></li><li>Speed: This game supports one or two players. It is not turn based, players play cards that are sequential to the table card as fast as they can. The first player to dispose of all their cards wins.</li><li>Poker: This is Five Card Draw poker. Players start with credit and aim to win as much as possible, it plays like a video poker game of 'Jacks High'. This product does not use a memory card to store a player's progress but in Poker the player can press the SELECT button and the game will generate a password which they can use in future games to restore their credit. Pressing the START button swaps the player into the Blackjack game.</li><li>Blackjack: This is a standard Blackjack game in which the player can generate passwords or swap into the Poker game as described above. The player's winnings are multiplied if they have special card combinations, for example 'Blackjack' - having the cards add up to twenty-one - multiplies the stake by five while a six card sequence adding up to twenty-one multiplies the stake by fifty. In both Poker and Blackjack when the player wins a hand they can choose to play a 'double or nothing' game such as 'Red or Black', Hi-Card select', Hi-Lo' etc</li><li>Concentration: This is a game for one to four players. Forty cards are dealt face down and players take turns revealing a pair of cards looking for a matching pair.</li></ul><p>Each game has customisable rules, and adjustable AI strength.</p>"},{"name":"Family Chess","year":2002,"developer":"I.Magic","url":"psx-chd-roms-f/Family%20Chess%20%28Japan%29.chd","filesize":626897,"score":"","genres":"Strategy > Top-down > Turn-based > Beat 'em up / brawler > Chess","desc":"<p>Chess is a popular table game in Europe.<br>Family Chess is playable by 1 to 2 players, and is a chess video game that guarantees satisfaction to any type of chess players, no matter you are a beginner or an expert.

The battles are turn-based, but have a timer for each turn; before the time runs out, the player has to input a combination of four moves for the hero (including punches, kicks, etc.). </p><p>There is also a \"dating sim\" element in the game. \"Important\" girls can be seen on a special screen called \"GPS\" (\"Gal Positioning System\"). If they are in trouble, they will have sweat on their faces. It is up to the player to decide whether to rescue the girl or not. Sometimes it is possible to become friendly with the girl through other means, such as participating in a club she likes. Walking the girl home increases her affection. By the end of the game, the hero will end up with the girl who likes him most and whom he has spent the most time with. The game has a schedule, keeping track of events such as holidays, girls' birthdays, etc., though the actual game is not real-time - a day ends when the player decides to have the hero go home, or as a conclusion of a story-related event.</p>"},{"name":"Firebugs","year":2002,"developer":"Attention to Detail Limited","url":"psx-chd-roms-f/Firebugs%20%28Europe%29%20%28En%2CFr%2CDe%2CEs%2CIt%2CNl%2CPt%2CSv%2CNo%2CDa%2CFi%29.chd","filesize":374055307,"score":"","genres":"Action > Racing / Driving > 1st-person > 3rd-person (Other) > Anime / Manga > Shooter > Sci-fi / futuristic","desc":"<p>Welcome to the Firebugs racing season, where teams of different worlds send their best racer to compete for fame and glory.

The young student Kazuki Takemura works as a test pilot with Kirishima Industries, a production company of military battle wanzers (walking panzers), mechanized walking robots with movement similar to that of a human being. Kazuki has just finished testing the combat capabilities of the new Zeinslev prototype in the lab. Finishing his day's tasks he is asked by his best friend Ryogo to help with a company delivery to the Japanese Defense Force (JDF) military based. This simple choice determines where Kazuki is when strange things begin happening in Japan. A large explosion, a wanzer theft, his sister Alysia being hunted, rumors of a powerful weapon, and accusations of involvement by agents of both the OCU and the USN all make the situation more complicated. Kazuki is swept up in a plot of conflicting loyalties and attacked by various factions. He will need to recruit additional characters and wanzers in order to be victorious in battle and investigate leads to uncover what is going on.</p><p><em>Front Mission 3</em>, like other games in the Front Mission Series is a turn-based strategy game featuring real-time environments, CG movies, mechanized robots and strategic battles. The game contains two independent storylines with different situations, environments and unique characters made up of different set of allies and enemies. The majority of the game takes place on the battlefield where Kazuki and his allies are controlled in an overhead view 3D environment. The game is tactical and nature, so the player chooses his unit and assigns where it will be moved and what action it will perfom. Typical actions include attacking with a shoulder weapon (missiles or gernades), attacking with a weapon held in the hand (ranged and melee), using items, guarding against future attack and simply ending the turn. As chaarcters fire weapons back and forth at each other, they will inflict damage to different parts of the wanzer. Areas that can be damaged and destroyed/disabled include arms, legs, and body. Complete damage to the body will 'destroy' the wanzer in battle, whereas disabling other parts will merely render it less effective. Each weapon has a damage type which includes (I) \"Impact\", (F) \"Flame\" and (P) \"Piercing\". In practice these types function as weapon \"elements\" which can be reduced with the proper armor coating, however it usually renders it vulnerable to another damage type. Typically Anti-I defense is very weak against Class-P attack and defending against that is weak from Class-F and defending against that is weak from Class-I. Each weapon carried by the wanzers is also classified as either Ranged, Melee, Shield or Missile . Each pilot can have a proficiency in these skills, making the usage of some weapons by them more effective than others. Pilots also learn special skills during battle, these are activated by experience points, and amount of weapon usage. Special abilities are very dependent on the types of actions being performed and items equipped, so for example the ability \"Double Shot\" requires a weapon equipped in each hand of the same weapon class.</p><p>Between combat missions, Kazuki is able to save his game as well as explore the \"network\". The network is a virtual internet, allowing connections to the (completely fictional) websites of organizations involved in the <em>Front Mission 3</em> plot. While exploration on the network is not required, it's exploration will uncover clues to some of the game's backstory as well as open up the opportunity to develop email contacts, obtain additional funds and unlock new wanzer gear.</p><p>Between certain missions, Kazuki will enter a town. These are represented by a simple graphical menu of different locations. Areas that can be visited typically include Pubs, Wanzer Equipment Shops, Wanzer Parts Shops and specific locations. Wanzers are mix-and-matchable so that feet from one model can be attached to another and different weapons carried. Different wanzer parts each have unique values for HP, accuracy, movement and armor. However each part and weapon has a \"weight\" value, which is determined by each individual Wanzer model's engine (as well as additional parts). A wanzer is always unable to carry more than it's maximum weight. Towns are also where Kazuki will often meet new characters and have conversations to uncover the plot.</p>"},{"name":"Front Mission: Alternative","year":1997,"developer":"Square Co., Ltd.","url":"psx-chd-roms-f/Front%20Mission%20Alternative%20%28Japan%29.chd","filesize":144777120,"score":"","genres":"Role-playing (RPG) > Strategy > 1st-person > 3rd-person (Other) > Anime / Manga > Turn-based > Mecha / giant robot > Sci-fi / futuristic","desc":"<p>The first game in the Front Mission series to take you to the African Continent.
