The player controls pilots of robots throughout the entire campaign, battling against various types of enemies on an isometric field. All main characters possess powers that can give them a necessary edge in the battle. When enemy units are defeated, characters earn \"prāna\", their willpower. When prāna increases to a certain level, characters can perform more powerful attacks on the enemy.</p><p>This game is actually a spiritual successor to the <em>Masou Kishin: The Lord of Elemental</em>, previously developed by Banpresto and Winky Soft. Banpresto went to develop the <em>Super Robot Wars/Taisen</em> franchise, while Winky Soft decided to make a game reminiscent of the original <em>Masou Kishin</em>. As such, the game shares many similarities with each other, including the combat, the gameplay, its mechanics, the science-fantasy setting, and even the design of the protagonist. However, the main story, while similar, plays out differently. Also, all combat in the game is performed on the playing field itself, i.e. it does not cut to a separate combat screen. The biggest addition to the genre is the character progression system in a \"visual novel\" style. After missions, players can talk to various characters and, depending on the choices, increase their loyalty levels. Such changes can have an impact on the performance of their teammates in battle.</p>"},{"name":"Sekai Saikyou Ginsei Igo 3","year":2003,"developer":"SilverStarJapan Co., Ltd."},{"name":"Sensible Soccer '98: European Club Edition","year":1998,"developer":"Sensible Software","url":"psx-chd-roms-s/Sensible%20Soccer%20%28Europe%29%20%28En%2CFr%2CDe%2CEs%2CIt%2CNl%29.chd","filesize":177364337,"score":"","genres":"Action > Sports > Top-down > Arcade > Football (European) / Soccer","desc":"<p><em>Sensible Soccer European Club Edition</em> is the followup sequel to Sensible Soccer '98.

Your eventual goal is to become the dominant civilization in the world, either by wiping out everybody else, or being the first to get a space ship to Alpha Centauri.</p><p>As the nation's leader, you have many responsibilities. You have to build cities, and then micromanage them, constructing various buildings. Most of people in your cities will be working on the neighbouring lands to get food (without it, your city won't survive or grow), production (used to build military units and buildings) and trade (which can be exchanged for money, science (see below) or luxuries that make people happy. You decide how much trade you want to invest into each of these areas.) You have to make sure that your people are in a good mood; if they get too unhappy, the city will collapse into disorder, and won't produce anything until you fix the situation. </p><p>If you're ambitious, you can build Wonders of the World - epic constructions, such as the Pyramids or the Hoover Dam. Each Wonder is an unique thing, and only one of each can exist in the world. They give you a lot of benefits if you complete them, but they take a long time to build, and many of them will eventually stop working. </p><p>There are other nations in the world, and there are also barbarians, so you'll have to invest into the military to protect yourself and to attack. Sure, you can sign peace treaties with other nations, and even exchange scientific knowledge with them (although sometimes they'll demand tribute from you), but eventually you'll probably have to fight. You control each of your military units on the world map, attacking your opponents' units and cities (possibly taking over them). </p><p>Not all units are for combat though. Settlers are used to build cities, create roads (for easier travel of your units) and improve the land around cities, increasing production. Diplomats can be sent to foreign cities to negotiate with the other nations or create embassies, but they can also bribe enemy units to join you and conduct espionage and sabotage in the enemies' cities. Caravans can be sent to faraway cities to increase trade in their home city, and they can also help in building Wonders of the World. </p><p>Scientific progress is an important part of the game. The more science your cities produce, the faster you research new technologies. Initially, you'll be finding out about the wonders of Alphabet or Bronze Working, but late in the game you'll be researching Computers and Robotics. Most technologies give you some new units, buildings and other things, although some have more interesting effects - for example, after inventing the Automobile, you'll find out that your citizens started producing pollution. Pollution is a bad thing; if there's too much of it, global warming may occur. </p><p>How your cities prosper depends partially on the type of government that your nation has.

If you don't choose the correct or appropriate option, you will not be able to make a contract and will have to wait until the musician appears again in the future. The band can be formed once a guitarist, bassist and drummer are hired. Then during the course of the gameplay, the band will have to make concerts in six different venues and release at least one CD under the three different recording companies. Promoting the gigs and CD releases are always essential to achieve success. During a concert, you can make few movements with the band members (except the drummer) and control the spotlights (and firework too but only in the last two venues).</p><p>There are 10 songs available, and to play each one at its \"fullest\", you will need to gather the best lineup. If the band play a song with members that are not the most \"adequate\", the sound will be different (worse) than when you use the best lineup. Therefore the attendance number and money gain will be obviously poor.</p><p>In the \"band meeting\", there are options such as \"group talk\" and \"rehearsal\". Choosing these two every single week will certainly influence the attendance of your upcoming gig and CD sales. Other options in band meeting include \"song list\" (where you can hear the songs you bought and read its lyrics), \"member change\", \"band break up\", \"gigs\" and \"CD release\".</p><p>In the \"band chart\" you can check the gig attendances, CD sales, and listen to the song that your band played in a specific gig. Listening to them is important to spot which are the worst or best musicians for a certain song.</p><p>All the members are replaceable except the vocalist, however you can still hire other four vocalists in order to buy other songs, but having a song doesn't guarantee that you can play it because each vocalist can only perform about four or them. A song can be bought only when a certain vocalist is under contract.</p><p>The game will be over only when the money is all gone, that means if you choose \"band break up\", the game will still continue as long as there's still money left, and you can start a new adventure with a new band. Meanwhile if a contracted musician is not used for a long period of time, he or she will eventually resign. Also, if the gameplay takes too long, the band will automatically disband by itself due to lack of motivation.</p><p>To finish the game, the band must release a cd under \"Bonny Record\", and reach an attendance of at least 65000 people in the Tokyo City Dome. To access this final gig, you will have to play a song with the best lineup for it, otherwise you will not be allowed to access this last venue. Once you reach or surpass that number, the ending movie will start playing.</p>"},{"name":"Sonic Wings Special","year":1996,"developer":"Video System Co., Ltd.","url":"psx-chd-roms-s/Sonic%20Wings%20Special%20%28Europe%29.chd","filesize":102403944,"score":6.6,"genres":"Action > Top-down > Arcade > Shooter > Flight / aviation","desc":"<p>A secret organization called Fata Morgana is developing a weapon that is capable of killing or wounding two-thirds of the world's population.
