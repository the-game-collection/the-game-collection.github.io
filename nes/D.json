In cities and palaces it is possible to talk to people, rest in inns and buy weapons, armor and items in shops.</p><p>When wandering around in the wilderness or through dungeons, the player character encounters randomly appearing enemies. Combat is turn-based, with the player selecting menu options while fighting. It is possible to attack with the equipped weapon, cast one of the few available spells (using up some of the magic energy), use an item, or try to run. All the battles in the game are exclusively one-on-one. Killing monsters yields experience, and the player character's attributes improve automatically when he levels up.</p><p>With the exception of the final location, the entire game world is theoretically open for exploration from the beginning. However, the enemies become increasingly tough as the player character attempts to move away from the starting town, effectively limiting him to confined areas determined by his level. The hero has limited hit points, loses them when attacked by enemies, and dies when he runs out of them, at which point he is automatically restored in a nearby town. It is possible to save the game only by talking to the king in the initial castle.</p>"},{"name":"Dragon Warrior II","year":1987,"developer":"Chunsoft Co., Ltd.","url":":Dragon Warrior II (USA)","filesize":127794,"score":6.4,"genres":"Role-playing (RPG) > Top-down > Turn-based > Japanese-style RPG (JRPG) > Fantasy > Regional differences","desc":"<p><em>Dragon Warrior II</em> is an early top-down RPG that expands and improves on its predecessor, Dragon Warrior.
