You control a little character whose main attack comes from his disembodied head. Yes, years before Rayman appeared, we already had a hero who used detachable appendages to attack his enemies.</p><p>Rather than the traditional power-ups, <em>Dynamite Headdy</em> enables you to swap your head for different kinds ‚Äì such as heads that heal you or heads that stick on to walls. You use your head in order to climb up on platforms as well, as you can grab hold of things with it, and on certain stages of the Mega Drive/Genesis version it is used to turn the game into a side-scrolling shooter, as you gain a propeller, jet, or bird head.

It is notable for using Virgin's \"Digicel\" technology, originally built for Disney's Aladdin. The game was also referred to by some publications as Dinoblades. DynoBlaze was cancelled for unknown reasons, but an extremely early prototype (dated January 1994) has since been dumped. Very little exists within this prototype, and the music is borrowed from RoboCop Versus The Terminator. A Sega Mega-CD version was also announced, but even less is known about that version. The game re-emerged as DinoBlaze: What's the Rumpus at CES 1995, this as a planned 3DO release, but it too was cancelled.</p>"}]
