In these events, the player initially faces a semi-final round and only qualifies for the final if ends in the top half. It's possible to watch the other semi-final.Hammer Throw combines a strong mashing sequence, along an accurate press of the action button to release the hammer, while Pole Vault combines an initial mashing sequence, a first tap on down to set the bar, then pressing up and the action button to release the pole and jump over the bar. Archery is a technical event where the player has three rounds with six arrows each, the winner being the one with the highest score on all three rounds.</p><p>The player can choose to compete for eight nations: Great Britain, France, Germany, Italy, hosts Spain, United Stats, Japan and the CIS (formerly the Soviet Union). Each nation has it's own sample of the anthem and a set of athletes to compete against the player. Each athlete is unique, and will perform differently according to the event: in some they are capable of breaking World Records, in others, lucky enough to get to a final or a top-6 spot. The competition is split in two tables: sorted by medals and by total score (the gold medalist gets 24 points, the 12th only 13).</p>"},{"name":"Olympic Summer Games","year":1996,"developer":"Tiertex Ltd.","url":"d#Olympic%20Summer%20Games%20%28USA%2C%20Europe%29.zip","filesize":718425,"score":5.9,"genres":"Sports > 1st-person > Diagonal-down > Side view > Isometric > Olympiad / mixed sports > Licensed","desc":"<p>Olympic Summer Games is the 16-bit official videogame of the 1996 Olympic Games held in Atlanta, the third and the last IOC official title to be released on the console.

Two players can compete head to head in the sprinting events, and a total of eight can play in the same game. Three difficulty levels allow competitive events for both rookies to veterans in the genre.</p><p>Sprinting events are a short and straight button mashing frenzy. 4 athletes compete simultaneously, the first winner advancing to the next round (two qualifiers and then the medal run). Only fast fingers and quick shotgun reaction can earn world record times. </p><p>Jumping events are a mix of shorter button mashing bursts combined with timely pressed jumps. From the straight forward high and long jump events (run and then set the jump angle) to the more elaborate triple jump (as the name suggests, three jumps must be carefully measured for world class results) and the complex pole vault, where a strong run must be followed by a sharp pole fixation and good a release upwards. Both long jump and triple jump have a first round composed by three jumps, the better eight progress into the second round, where they are given three more jumps. In the high jump and pole vault the competition continues until all athletes miss three consecutive jumps.</p><p>The throwing events (discus and javelin) work in the same fashion as the jumping events, although trickier to pull, as the setting of the angle must be followed by a timely release. Each player is entitled to three throws, the top eight allowed three more attempts.</p><p>Finally, the shooting events. Archery is a three-round competition where the goal is to amass as many points as possible by shooting at the inner rings of the target. With six arrows per round, each shot must be calculated according to the wind, choosing between steady aim and lower tension (must be aimed upwards and compensating the wind) or higher tension but a jumpy aim (can be aimed directly at the \"gold\" points). Skeet is a five round competition where the goal is to hit five clay pigeons before they disappear off-screen with two slugs for each.</p>"},{"name":"Onslaught","year":1991,"developer":"Realms","url":"d#Onslaught%20%28USA%2C%20Europe%29%20%28Unl%29.zip","filesize":236155,"score":6.7,"genres":"Action > Side view > Platform > Fantasy","desc":"<p>As a highly respected warrior, you are attempting to conquer as many regions as possible.
